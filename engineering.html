                <hr>
                <p>
                    The internet is full of generous people willing to help you for free. We took help of hundreds of such people to build each part of the product. To pay it back, we have made an <strong>Open Company</strong>.

                    Almost everthing we build at Rewave is open sourced and avaiable on Rewave's Github (<a href="http://github.com/rewave" target="_blank">github.com/rewave</a>).

                    Feel free to fork and build over our work :)

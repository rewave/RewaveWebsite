					div.step 
						h2 Step-3 (Optional) : Create an alias for quick access
						p You can start the server from the folder each time, but for quicker access, open your .bashrc file, generally located in ~/home directory and add the following line to it :
						p.code alias rewave_server = './{~/home/username/RewaveServer}/rewave_server'
						p Make sure to replace {} with the location of RewaveServer (without curly brackets). 

						p Now you can access Rewave Server via command line by typing : 
						p.code $ rewave_server
